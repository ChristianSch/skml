================================

This project implements a number of multi-label classification (MLC) problem
transformation methods, multi-label ensembles as well as adapted algorithms
with scikit-learn compatible estimators.

Note that skml is in an early stage, and if you observe any unexpected behavior
or have questions, please create an
`issue <https://github.com/christiansch/skml/issues>`_.

Please refer to the :ref:`user_guide` for an overview or background information.
The :ref:`auto_examples/index` section holds simple examples to common problems.
